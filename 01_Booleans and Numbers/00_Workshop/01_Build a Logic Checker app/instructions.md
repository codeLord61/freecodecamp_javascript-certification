Step 1
In this workshop, you'll learn how to work with conditional statements and comparison operators.

Begin by declaring a variable named truthyOrFalsy and assign it the boolean value true.

Step 2
As you learned in a previous lesson, booleans are a data type with only true and false values.

A truthy value is a value that evaluates to true in a boolean context. Examples of truthy values are:

Non-empty strings
Non-zero numbers
The boolean true
And other values you'll meet later on.

You can use the Boolean() function to check the truthiness of a value. For example, Boolean("Hello World!") will return true because "Hello World!" is truthy.

Now, call Boolean(truthyOrFalsy) and log the result to the console.

Step 3
Change the assignment of truthyOrFalsy by setting its value to "freeCodeCamp". You will still see true logged to the console because a non-empty string is a truthy value.

Step 4
Falsy values are values that evaluate to false in a boolean context. Examples of falsy values are:

"" (empty string)
0
false
null
undefined
NaN
You'll meet all of these going through this coursework.

For now, change the assignment of truthyOrFalsy by setting its value to an empty string. After that, you'll see false logged to the console.

Step 5
Now that you know what truthy and falsy values are, remove both your variable declaration and console.log statement from your code.

Step 6
Declare a variable named hasDeveloperJob and assign it the boolean value true.

Step 7
A conditional statement is used to run code depending on a condition. It is composed of the if keyword, followed by a condition enclosed by parentheses, and a body enclosed by curly braces. Here's an example of an if statement:

Example Code
if (condition) {
  console.log("condition is truthy");
}
When condition is a truthy value (non-empty string, non-zero number, true, etc.) the code within the if statement's body is executed.

Below your variable, create an if statement that uses hasDeveloperJob as its condition. Within the body of your if statement, log "Timmy is employed as a developer." to the console.

Step 8
Declare another variable named isTimmyAGamer and assign it the boolean false.

Step 9
Now create another if statement that uses isTimmyAGamer as its condition. Inside the body of your if statement, log "Timmy loves to play World of Warcraft." to the console.

Note that you won't see anything logged to the console as the condition of your new if statement is false.

Step 10
Declare another variable named timmyAge and set it to 18.

Step 11
Comparison operators allow you to compare values and write more complex conditional statements.

Example Code
if (today == birthday) {
  console.log("Happy Birthday!");
}
For example, the code above logs "Happy Birthday!" to the console only when the values of the variables today and birthday are equal.

Create a third if statement. For its condition, use the >= operator to check if timmyAge is greater than or equal to 16.

Inside the body of your new if statement, log "Timmy is old enough to drive." to the console.

Step 12
A conditional statement can have an else clause, which runs code when the if condition is falsy. Here's an example of an if...else statement:

Example Code
if (condition) {
  console.log("condition is truthy");
} else {
  console.log("condition is falsy");
}
Add an else clause to the existing if statement. Inside the body of your else clause, log "Timmy is not old enough to drive." to the console.

Step 13
Finally, change the declaration of timmyAge and set it to a number less than 16. After that you'll see "Timmy is not old enough to drive." logged to the console.
